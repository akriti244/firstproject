           <p>How Did Mathematics Develop?
            In the 6th century BC, the study of mathematics began with the 
            Pythagoreans, as a “demonstrative discipline”. The word 
            mathematics originated from the Greek word “mathema”, which 
            means “subject of instruction”.</p>
